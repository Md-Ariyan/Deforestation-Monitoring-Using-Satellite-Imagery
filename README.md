Deforestation Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery
o Deforestation monitoring using satellite imaging utilizes satellite imagesto detect and track changes in forest cover over time.
o By employing deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and segmentation models like U-Net, this method can classify and analyze satellite data to identify deforested areas accurately.
o The process involves data collection, preprocessing (resizing, normalization),model training (using transfer learning, appropriate loss functions, and optimizers), and evaluation (using metrics like accuracy).
o The trained models are then integrated into environmental monitoring systems to enable real-time or batch processing, facilitating timely interventions to prevent illegal logging and habitat destruction.
Key steps include:
• Data Collection and Preparation: Gather and label satellite images from sources like Landsat Sentinel.
• Data Preprocessing: Standardize image sizes and normalize pixel values,then split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
• Model Selection and Architecture: Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and segmentation models like U-Net for detailed analysis.
• Model Training: Employ transfer learning, appropriate loss functions, and optimizers such as Adam or SGD.
• Model Evaluation: Assess the model using accuracy, precision, recall,F1-score, Intersection over Union (IoU), and pixel accuracy.
• Deployment and Inference: Preprocess new images similarly to training images and integrate the model into a monitoring system for real-time or batch processing.
This approach utilizes deep learning to improve global forest monitoring and conservation efforts.
